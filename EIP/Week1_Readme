Definitions

1.Convolution: Multiplying matrix of pixels/data with a filter to extract information with reduction of size of the matrix.

2.Filters/Kernels:It extracts specific information or feature from the data/image. 

3.EPOCHS: Number of epochs refers to the number of times the whole dataset is passed through the network.

4.1x1 convolution: 1x1 combines features which are linked to each other resulting in Z channel dimensionalty reduction.

5.3x3 convolution: it is reffered as kernal/filter/feature extractor which extracts specific feature.
convoluting on 3x3 reduces the dimensions by 2 pixels.

6.Feature Maps: Feature maps/channels contains information of one specific feature. It is collection of all similar features.

7.Activation function: It performs non-linear transformation to the input making it capable to learn and perform more complex tasks. 

8.Receptive Field: receptive fields corresponds to the amount of information captured at each layer of the network
